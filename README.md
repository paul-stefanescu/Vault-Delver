# Vault Delver
Vault Delver:
2D Dungeon Crawler with Hack’n’Slash combat and a top-down view.
The game has 2 different mob types, a boss and a fully functional score system. Part of the assets are self-made, including the Player, Map and Music.
The game was created as a high school project by me and a friend, trying our hand at making our first game.
My contribution:
•	Implemented the combat, the enemies and the Player movement and animations.
•	Built the score system and the UI.
•	Created the map using Tiled.
